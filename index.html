						<h2>Broken Access Control</h2>
						<p>
							Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions.
							Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or performing a business function outside the user's limits.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Common access control vulnerabilities include:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Violation of the principle of least privilege or deny by default, where access should only be granted for particular capabilities, roles, or users, but is available to anyone.
								</li>
								<li>
									Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL (parameter tampering or force browsing), internal application state, or the HTML page, or by using an attack tool modifying API requests.
								</li>
								<li>
									Permitting viewing or editing someone else's account, by providing its unique identifier (insecure direct object references)
								</li>
								<li>
									Accessing API with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE.
								</li>
								<li>
									Elevation of privilege. Acting as a user without being logged in or acting as an admin when logged in as a user.
								</li>
								<li>
									Metadata manipulation, such as replaying or tampering with a JSON Web Token (JWT) access control token, or a cookie or hidden field manipulated to elevate privileges or abusing JWT invalidation.
								</li>
								<li>
									CORS misconfiguration allows API access from unauthorized/untrusted origins.
								</li>
								<li>
									Force browsing to authenticated pages as an unauthenticated user or to privileged pages as a standard user.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							How to Prevent
						</h3>
						<p>
							Access control is only effective in trusted server-side code or server-less API, where the attacker cannot modify the access control check or metadata.
						</p>
						<p class="fragment">
							Developers and QA staff should include functional access control unit and integration tests.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Except for public resources, deny by default.</li>
								<li>
									Implement access control mechanisms once and re-use them throughout the application, including minimizing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) usage.
								</li>
								<li>
									Model access controls should enforce record ownership rather than accepting that the user can create, read, update, or delete any record.
								</li>
								<li>
									Unique application business limit requirements should be enforced by domain models.
								</li>
								<li>
									Disable web server directory listing and ensure file metadata (e.g., .git) and backup files are not present within web roots.
								</li>
								<li>
									Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate (e.g., repeated failures).
								</li>
								<li>
									Rate limit API and controller access to minimize the harm from automated attack tooling.
								</li>
								<li>
									Stateful session identifiers should be invalidated on the server after logout. Stateless JWT tokens should rather be short-lived so that the window of opportunity for an attacker is minimized. For longer lived JWTs it's highy recommended to follow the OAuth standards to revoke access.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Examples</h3>	
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							<b>Scenario #1:</b> The application uses unverified data in a SQL call that is accessing account information:
						</p>
						<pre><code data-trim contenteditable style="font-size: 18px;">
							pstmt.setString(1, request.getParameter("acct"));
							ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( );
						</code></pre>
						<p>
							An attacker simply modifies the browser's 'acct' parameter to send whatever account number they want. If not correctly verified, the attacker can access any user's account.
						</p>
						<pre><code data-trim contenteditable style="font-size: 18px;">
							https://example.com/app/accountInfo?acct=notmyacct
						</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							<b>Scenario #2:</b> An attacker simply forces browses to target URLs. Admin rights are required for access to the admin page.
						</p>
						<pre><code data-trim contenteditable style="font-size: 18px;">
							https://example.com/app/getappInfo
							https://example.com/app/admin_getappInfo
						</code></pre>
						<p>
							If an unauthenticated user can access either page, it's a flaw. If a non-admin can access the admin page, this is a flaw.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Cryptographic Failures</h2>
						<p class="fragment">
							The first thing is to determine the protection needs of data in transit and at rest.
						</p>
						<p class="fragment">
							Some data may require extra protetion.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								For example, passwords, credit card numbers, health records, personal information, and business secrets require extra protection, mainly if that data falls under privacy laws, e.g., EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or regulations, e.g., financial data protection such as PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>How to prevent</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">
								Classify data processed, stored, or transmitted by an application. Identify which data is sensitive.
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">
								Don't store sensitive data unnecessarily. Discard it as soon as possible or use PCI DSS compliant tokenization or even truncation.
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">
								Make sure to encrypt all sensitive data at rest.
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">
								Encrypt all data in transit with secure protocols
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">
								Disable caching for response that contain sensitive data.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Examples</h3>
						<p class="fragment r-fit-text">
							<b>Scenario #1:</b> An application encrypts credit card numbers in a database using automatic database encryption. However, this data is automatically decrypted when retrieved, allowing a SQL injection flaw to retrieve credit card numbers in clear text.
						</p>
						<p class="fragment r-fit-text">
							<b>Scenario #2:</b> The password database uses unsalted or simple hashes to store everyone's passwords. A file upload flaw allows an attacker to retrieve the password database. All the unsalted hashes can be exposed with a rainbow table of pre-calculated hashes. Hashes generated by simple or fast hash functions may be cracked by GPUs, even if they were salted.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>
							Injection
						</h2>
						<p>
							Some of the more common injections are SQL, NoSQL, OS command, Object Relational Mapping (ORM), LDAP, and Expression Language (EL) or Object Graph Navigation Library (OGNL) injection.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>
									User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application.
								</li>
								<li>
									Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware escaping are used directly in the interpreter.
								</li>
								<li>
									Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM) search parameters to extract additional, sensitive records.
								</li>
								<li>
									Hostile data is directly used or concatenated. The SQL or command contains the structure and malicious data in dynamic queries, commands, or stored procedures.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>How to prevent</h3>
						<p>Preventing injection requires keeping data separate from commands and queries.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>
									The preferred option is to use a safe API, which avoids using the interpreter entirely, provides a parameterized interface, or migrates to Object Relational Mapping Tools (ORMs).
								</li>
								<li>
									Use positive server-side input validation.
								</li>
								<li>
									For any residual dynamic queries, escape special characters using the specific escape syntax for that interpreter.
								</li>
								<li>
									Use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries to prevent mass disclosure of records in case of SQL injection.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Examples</h3>
						<p  class="r-fit-text">
							<b>Scenario #1:</b> An application uses untrusted data in the construction of the following vulnerable SQL call:
						</p>
						<pre><code data-trim contenteditable style="font-size: 14px;">
							String query = "SELECT \* FROM accounts WHERE custID='" + request.getParameter("id") + "'";
						</code></pre>
						<p  class="r-fit-text">
							<b>Scenario #2:</b> Similarly, an application’s blind trust in frameworks may result in queries that are still vulnerable, (e.g., Hibernate Query Language (HQL)):
						</p>
						<pre><code data-trim contenteditable style="font-size: 14px;">
							Query HQLQuery = session.createQuery("FROM accounts WHERE custID='" + request.getParameter("id") + "'");
						</code></pre>
						<p  class="r-fit-text">
							In both cases, the attacker modifies the ‘id’ parameter value in their browser to send: ‘ or ‘1’=’1.
						</p>
						<p  class="r-fit-text">
							This changes the meaning of both queries to return all the records from the accounts table. More dangerous attacks could modify or delete data or even invoke stored procedures.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>
							Insecure Design
						</h2>
						<p>
							Insecure design is a broad category representing different weaknesses, expressed as “missing or ineffective control design.”
						</p>
						<p>
							And secure design is a culture and methodology that constantly evaluates threats and ensures that code is robustly designed and tested to prevent known attack methods.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							How to prevent
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">
								Establish and use a library of secure design patterns or paved road ready to use components
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">
								Use threat modeling for critical authentication, access control, business logic, and key flows
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">
								Integrate plausibility checks at each tier of your application	
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">
								Limit resource consumption by user or service
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Examples</h3>
						<p>
						 A cinema chain allows group booking discounts and has a maximum of fifteen attendees before requiring a deposit. Attackers could threat model this flow and test if they could book six hundred seats and all cinemas at once in a few requests, causing a massive loss of income.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>
							Security Misconfiguration
						</h2>
						<p>This position is about application general vulnerability</p>
						<p class="fragment">
							Without a concerted, repeatable application security configuration process, systems are at a higher risk.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							The application might be vulnerable if the application is:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack or improperly configured permissions on cloud services.
								</li>
								<li>
									Default accounts and their passwords are still enabled and unchanged.
								</li>
								<li>
									Error handling reveals stack traces or other overly informative error messages to users.
								</li>
								<li>
									For upgraded systems, the latest security features are disabled or not configured securely.
								</li>
								<li>
									The security settings in the application servers, application frameworks (e.g., Struts, Spring, ASP.NET), libraries, databases, etc., are not set to secure values.
								</li>
								<li>
									The server does not send security headers or directives, or they are not set to secure values.
								</li>
								<li>
									The software is out of date or vulnerable (covered in next position).
								</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							How to prevent
						</h3>
						<p>
							Secure installation processes should be implemented
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							This includes:
							<ul>
								<li>
									A minimal platform without any unnecessary features, components, documentation, and samples. Remove or do not install unused features and frameworks.
								</li>
								<li>
									A task to review and update the configurations appropriate to all security notes, updates, and patches as part of the patch management process
								</li>
								<li>
									Sending security directives to clients, e.g., Security Headers.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Examples
						</h3>
						<p class="r-fit-text">
							<b>Scenario #1:</b> The application server's configuration allows detailed error messages, e.g., stack traces, to be returned to users. This potentially exposes sensitive information or underlying flaws such as component versions that are known to be vulnerable.
						</p>
						<p class="r-fit-text">
							<b>Scenario #2:</b> A cloud service provider (CSP) has default sharing permissions open to the Internet by other CSP users. This allows sensitive data stored within cloud storage to be accessed.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>
							Vulnerable and Outdated Components
						</h2>
						<p>
							Application is likely vulnerable :
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								If the software is unsupported, or out of date.
							</li>
							<li>
								If you do not fix or upgrade the underlying platform, frameworks, and dependencies in a risk-based, timely fashion.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							This also includes:
							1.If you do not scan for vulnerabilities regularly and subscribe to security bulletins related to the components you use.
							2.If software developers do not test the compatibility of updated, upgraded, or patched libraries.
							3.If you do not secure the components’ configurations (see Security Misconfiguration).
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							How to prevent
						</h3>
						<p>
							Every organization must ensure an ongoing plan for monitoring, triaging, and applying updates or configuration changes for the lifetime of the application or portfolio.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							1.Remove unused dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files, and documentation.
							2.Only obtain components from official sources over secure links.
							3.Continuously inventory the versions of both client-side and server-side components (e.g., frameworks, libraries) and their dependencies using tools like versions, OWASP Dependency Check, retire.js, etc.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Examples
						</h3>
						<p>
							There are automated tools to help attackers find unpatched or misconfigured systems. For example, the Shodan IoT search engine can help you find devices that still suffer from Heartbleed vulnerability patched in April 2014.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>
							Identification and Authentication Failures
						</h2>
						<p>
							Confirmation of the user's identity, authentication, and session management is critical to protect against authentication-related attacks.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							There may be authentication weaknesses if the application:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Permits automated attacks such as credential stuffing, where the attacker has a list of valid usernames and passwords.
								</li>
								<li>
									Permits brute force or other automated attacks.
								</li>
								<li>
									Permits default, weak, or well-known passwords, such as "Password1" or "admin/admin".
								</li>
								<li>
									Uses plain text, encrypted, or weakly hashed passwords data stores (see Cryptographic Failures).
								</li>
								<li>
									Has missing or ineffective multi-factor authentication.
								</li>
								<li>
									Exposes session identifier in the URL. or Reuse it after successful login.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							How to prevent
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Where possible, implement multi-factor authentication
							</li>
							<li>
								Do not ship or deploy with any default credentials, particularly for admin users.
							</li>
							<li>
								Implement weak password checks
							</li>
							<li>
								Limit or increasingly delay failed login attempts
							</li>
							<li>
								Use a server-side, secure, built-in session manager that generates a new random session ID with high entropy after login
							</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							1. to prevent automated credential stuffing, brute force, and stolen credential reuse attacks.
							4. here be careful not to create a denial of service scenario.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Examples
						</h3>
						<p>
							<b>Scenario #1:</b> Credential stuffing, the use of lists of known passwords, is a common attack.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Scenario #2:</b> Application session timeouts aren't set correctly.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							1.Suppose an application does not implement automated threat or credential stuffing protection. In that case, the application can be used as a password oracle to determine if the credentials are valid.<br>
							2.A user uses a public computer to access an application. Instead of selecting "logout," the user simply closes the browser tab and walks away. An attacker uses the same browser an hour later, and the user is still authenticated.
						</aside>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>
							Software and Data Integrity Failures
						</h2>
						<p>
							Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources, repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs). An insecure CI/CD pipeline can introduce the potential for unauthorized access, malicious code, or system compromise. Lastly, many applications now include auto-update functionality, where updates are downloaded without sufficient integrity verification and applied to the previously trusted application. Attackers could potentially upload their own updates to be distributed and run on all installations. Another example is where objects or data are encoded or serialized into a structure that an attacker can see and modify is vulnerable to insecure deserialization.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							How to prevent
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Use digital signatures or similar mechanisms to verify the software or data is from the expected source and has not been altered.
							</li>
							<li>
								Ensure libraries and dependencies, such as npm, are consuming trusted repositories.
							</li>
							<li>
								Ensure that your CI/CD pipeline has proper segregation, configuration, and access control to ensure the integrity of the code flowing through the build and deploy processes.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Examples
						</h3>
						<p>
							<b>SolarWinds malicious update:</b> Nation-states have been known to attack update mechanisms, with a notable attack being the SolarWinds Orion attack.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							The company that develops the software had secure build and update integrity processes. Still, these were able to be subverted, and for several months, the firm distributed a highly targeted malicious update to more than 18,000 organizations, of which around 100 or so were affected. This is one of the most far-reaching and most significant breaches of this nature in history.

						<h2>
							Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
						</h2>
						<p>
							This category is to help detect, escalate, and respond to active breaches. Without logging and monitoring, breaches cannot be detected.
						</p>
						<p class="fragment">
							You are vulnerable to information leakage by making logging and alerting events visible to a user or an attacker (see 1. <a href="#/3">Broken Access Control</a>).
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring, and active response occurs any time:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins, and high-value transactions, are not logged.
								</li>
								<li>
									Logs of applications and APIs are not monitored for suspicious activity.
								</li>
								<li>
									Appropriate alerting thresholds and response escalation processes are not in place or effective.

						<h3>
							How to prevent
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>

						<h2>
							Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
						</h2>
						<p>
							SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL).
							</p>
							<p>
								As modern web applications provide end-users with convenient features, fetching a URL becomes a common scenario. As a result, the incidence of SSRF is increasing. Also, the severity of SSRF is becoming higher due to cloud services and the complexity of architectures.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							How to prevent
						</h3>
						<p>
							Developers can prevent SSRF by implementing some or all the following defense in depth controls:
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>
								From Network layer
							</b>
							<ul class="r-fit-text">
								<li>
									Segment remote resource access functionality in separate networks
								</li>
								<li>
									Enforce “deny by default” firewall policies
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>
								From Application layer
							</b>
							<ul class="r-fit-text">
								<li>
									Sanitize and validate all client-supplied input data
								</li>
								<li>
									Do not send raw responses to clients
								</li>
								<li>
									Disable HTTP redirections
								</li>
								<li>
									Be aware of the URL consistency to avoid attacks such as DNS rebinding and “time of check, time of use” (TOCTOU) race conditions
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Additional Measures to consider:<br>
								Don't deploy other security relevant services on front systems (e.g. OpenID). Control local traffic on these systems (e.g. localhost)
							<br>
								For frontends with dedicated and manageable user groups use network encryption (e.g. VPNs) on independent systems to consider very high protection needs
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Examples
						</h3>
						<p class="r-fit-text">
							Attackers can use SSRF to attack systems protected behind web application firewalls, firewalls, or network ACLs, using scenarios such as:
						</p>
						<p class="r-fit-text">
							<b>Scenario #1:</b> Port scan internal servers – If the network architecture is unsegmented, attackers can map out internal networks and determine if ports are open or closed on internal servers from connection results or elapsed time to connect or reject SSRF payload connections.
						</p>
						<p class="r-fit-text">
							<b>Scenario #2:</b> Compromise internal services – The attacker can abuse internal services to conduct further attacks such as Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS).
